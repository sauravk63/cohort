JavaScript Foundation
------------------------------

compiled languages:

---> compilers convert high level code(s) into 0's and 1's which can go into your machine and run.
---> first need to complile and then run
---> usually don't compile if there's an error in the code
    eg:C, C++, Java, Rust, Golang


Interpreted languages:

---> No need to compile
---> Interprets line by line
---> Can run partially if the error comes later
    eg: Python, JS

strict mode - cannot change datatype in the middle of the code
dynamic mode - can change the variable type. later TypeScript came into the picture

single threaded nature of JS:

can use only one core at a time
difficult to make scalable systems 
multithreading can be achieved
interprets one line at a time
